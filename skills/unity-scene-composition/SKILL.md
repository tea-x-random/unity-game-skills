description: "Define and enforce visual composition for Unity scenes before asset generation or world assembly: camera profile (orthographic/perspective, yaw, pitch, lens, framing), visual layers (background/far/mid/gameplay/foreground/UI), focal path, negative space, big-medium-small shape ratio, prop density, color zoning, occlusion budget, shadow/contact-darkening rules, prop-family distribution, and screenshot-based acceptance tests. Use when scenes are mechanically valid but visually weak, when building a BeautyCell/golden screen, when placing assets from the approved registry, when writing composition.yaml, when choosing foreground/midground/background roles, when setting camera/contracts for generated assets, or when level layout needs visual hierarchy beyond grid/board coordinates. Pairs with unity-game-layout (geometry/coordinate correctness), unity-asset-pipeline (approved registry + asset contracts), unity-art-direction (style_id + palette/material/camera intent), unity-graphics (lighting/render lock), and unity-ui-designer (UI safe area/readability)."

# Unity scene composition

This skill owns the **visual hierarchy contract** for scenes. `unity-game-layout` makes coordinates/boards/grids correct; this skill makes the screen read like a finished game: clear focal path, controlled density, foreground/midground/background depth, deliberate color zones, and screenshot-tested composition.

> Do not generate production assets or assemble a scene until `composition.yaml` exists and agrees with `art-spec.yaml` and each asset's `camera_contract`. Asset contracts without a composition contract still let agents improvise scale, angle, density, and visual role.

## Inputs

- `Assets/GameArt/_ArtDirection/art-spec.yaml` (`unity-art-direction`) — style_id, palette, material, lighting, camera intent, mobile budgets.
- `Assets/Art/Approved/registry.yaml` (`unity-asset-pipeline`) — approved prefabs and their composition roles/budgets.
- Level/gameplay requirements (`unity-gameplay-systems`, `unity-game-layout`) — playable path, grid/board, interactables, spawn zones, UI safe area.

## Output: `composition.yaml`

Create `Assets/GameArt/_ArtDirection/composition.yaml` from `references/composition-template.yaml`. It must define:

- **camera profile** — projection, yaw, pitch, lens/ortho size, framing, target device aspect;
- **visual layers** — background, far, midground, gameplay, foreground, UI;
- **focal path** — first/second/third read and how the eye travels;
- **shape rhythm** — big/medium/small ratio and silhouette spacing;
- **density rules** — interesting-object budget per screen and per layer;
- **color zoning** — quiet gameplay area vs saturated reward/focal area;
- **occlusion budget** — how much foreground can obscure play;
- **shadow/contact rules** — direction, softness, contact-darkening strength;
- **family distribution** — how many members/variants of each approved family per screen;
- **screenshot tests** — target frames and acceptance gates.

## Workflow

1. **Lock the camera first.** Choose a single gameplay camera profile for the BeautyCell and first playable slice. Record projection/yaw/pitch/lens/ortho size in `composition.yaml`; every asset `camera_contract` must match it unless explicitly marked UI/background.
2. **Assign visual layers.** Put gameplay-critical objects in `gameplay`; decoration in `midground`/`background`; atmospheric occluders in `foreground` with a strict occlusion budget; UI in safe-area-aware `ui`.
3. **Define the focal path.** Write three reads: (1) main gameplay goal, (2) next action/reward, (3) world flavor. If the first read is not gameplay, fix color/scale/light before adding more assets.
4. **Budget density.** Give each object a `density_cost` (small=1, medium=2, large/hero=3) and set a per-screen max. Do not solve an empty scene by scattering random props.
5. **Zone color and contrast.** Reserve highest saturation/contrast for interactables, rewards, and focal accents. Backgrounds and filler props must recede.
6. **Place only registry assets.** Read `unity-asset-pipeline` registry entries, filter by `composition.layer`, `visual_weight`, `allowed_zones`, and `density_cost`; never drag source art or unapproved prefabs into the scene.
7. **Normalize scale + grounding.** Set target screen-height percent per role and apply one shared `shadow_profile`/contact-darkening rule. Foreground actors/props without a consistent contact shadow read as floating stickers.
8. **Capture screenshots.** Use `unity-mcp-bridge` `manage_camera(screenshot)` or the BeautyCell renderer. Compare against the golden screen and run the checklist in `references/screenshot-acceptance.md`.
9. **Iterate by moving/removing first, not generating more.** If composition fails, fix camera, scale, contrast, density, and layering before generating additional assets.

## Layer rules

- **Background:** low contrast, low detail, no hard edges competing with gameplay. Supports mood only.
- **Far:** depth hints/parallax shapes; never occludes play.
- **Midground:** readable props and obstacles; primary place for environment kit variation.
- **Gameplay:** path, units, player, enemies, puzzle pieces, interactables. Highest readability.
- **Foreground:** optional framing/vignette elements; strict occlusion budget (usually 0–8% of gameplay area).
- **UI:** safe-area aware; uses a related but more legible material/color treatment; never fights gameplay focal path.

## Big / medium / small shape ratio

A premium screen usually needs shape hierarchy: 1–2 big anchors, 3–6 medium supports, and many small details only where the eye can rest. If every prop is the same screen height, the scene reads like a sticker pile. Encode target screen-height ranges in `composition.yaml` and enforce through asset `target_screen_height_percent`.

## Layer contrast budget

Do not apply one identical prompt/style intensity to every layer. The background/ground must usually spend **less** contrast, outline, and saturation budget than gameplay:

- gameplay/interactables: highest contrast, strongest outline, most saturated accents;
- hero/foreground props: high readability, but fewer than gameplay-critical objects;
- midground/filler props: medium contrast, lower density;
- background/ground: low contrast, low saturation, sparse detail, thin/no outline.

If a ground tile has the same bold black outline and hot accent palette as characters, the screenshot will look busy even when each asset is well drawn. Fix layer contrast before adding post-processing.

## Contact shadows / grounding

Every object that touches the world needs a consistent grounding treatment. Prefer a shared soft blob shadow or contact-AO prefab referenced by `shadow_profile`, with one global light/shadow direction. Do not rely on shadows baked into individual generated PNGs — they disagree once composited and break the BeautyCell.

## Screenshot acceptance

Do not rely on prose. A composition pass includes screenshots at the target device aspect plus at least one alternate aspect. Use `references/screenshot-acceptance.md` and record the screenshot paths in the BeautyCell or scene QA report. A scene that only passes in Scene View is not approved.

## Relationship to other skills

- `unity-game-layout`: grid/board/world-coordinate correctness. Use first for collision/placement logic, then this skill for visual hierarchy.
- `unity-asset-pipeline`: approved registry + asset contracts; this skill consumes registry assets and writes composition constraints back into contracts.
- `unity-art-direction`: global style/palette/material/camera intent; this skill turns it into screen-space rules.
- `unity-graphics`: lighting/post/material implementation; this skill specifies what lighting must communicate.
- `unity-ui-designer`: UI readability/safe area; this skill allocates UI's visual role in the whole frame.
